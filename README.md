This repository demonstrates how to plot latitude and longitude coordinates on a map with the help of `geopandas` library. At the end of the notebook, we overlay all plots to produce an animated image using `celluloid`.

The dataset can be obtained from [New York City Taxi Trip Duration](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data).
